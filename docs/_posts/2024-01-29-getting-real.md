The story is told of the young man who comes back home after meeting a prospective match. His mother asks
him, "How was she?". The young man answers, "She wasn't so pretty, but that didn't bother me. And she didn't have the
most fine character, but that also didn't bother me. She doesn't come from such a good family, but that didn't bother me..."
And he continued down a long list of things which didn't bother him about the young woman he had gone to meet.
Finally, his mother cuts him off, and asks, "Why did none of that bother you??"

"Because I'm not interested in the match!"

A person can go through life and never be angry at his troubles, or feel upset at G-d, or have any struggles with matters of faith. He prides himself on
his sanctity. As he continues to mature and deepen his connection to the (perceived) dual realities of heaven and earth, something changes.
Suddenly he finds himself dealing with negative emotions towards his problems and his Creator. "Where did I go wrong?" he wonders.

Apathy can be mistaken for strength, then struggle for weakness, until there is a strength which can be mistaken for apathy.

A person who cares about nothing is never upset. When he begins to care and live, he is faced with a world of emotions which
he never had to deal with, and has a new challenge: live within, and stay above. Be a part of the world, and maintain your connection to the eternal.
