# Flutter Navigation
Nested navigators, where there are tabs, and one or more tabs have their own navigation independent of the others, are a rite of passage which all flutter developers must go through.

Navigation in flutter isn’t difficult per se, but it is something you have to wrap your head around. I found [this article](https://medium.com/coding-with-flutter/flutter-case-study-multiple-navigators-with-bottomnavigationbar-90eb6caa6dbf) to be very helpful. I don’t know that I would recommend copy-pasta ing his precise methodology, but he brings a lot of the critical concepts out in stark relief in a small app.
