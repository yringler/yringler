It's so late  
And I'm thinking how you're doing  
I'm so tired  
But I just can't fall asleep  
Try to hope  
That you're ok  
But the future looks so bleak  
And it's so late

It's so early  
And I'm thinking how you're doing  
Can't believe it  
Even though I'd thought it was  
Day is starting  
Your suns already setting  
Or did it just start to shine  
So bright  
So far away  
And it's so early
