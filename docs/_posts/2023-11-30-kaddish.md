A dozen times a day
I say your name is great
And holy
I see their faces.
The world is as you will
I know you are the king
So why
Do I shake with their fear?

Where is salvation
Where is Messiah
In our life
And in the days
Of all of your children
Is your name so great?
And still

A dozen times a day
I say your great name
Is blessed
For ever and ever
And ever.
Where is the praise
The beauty and the splendor
Thick stench
Coarse hands
A shattered world.
Is your name still higher
than every comfort?

I know you are our father
I know you are the fire
In the thorns
Their pain and blood is yours.
But we are so small
Bring your peace in heaven
